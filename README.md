# In-Cog-Nito
Access Incognito mode!
Working as of v127
Originally I had found a really complex way to get to incognito, so I've summed it down into a more compact and easy way. I'm not sure it will for anyone, but I sure know it works for my Chromebook :P
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS.

# Instructions
1. Find a place nearby where you can access a public wifi without a password. THIS CANNOT BE YOUR SCHOOL'S WIFI. I recommend using a library.
2. If you connect to the right place, the wifi should get confused that you are accessing an unknown network without password, and it will open up a notification to sign in.
3. Press the notification and it should open you to a pop-up window with a link.
4. Right click the pop-up window and press "move to a new tab".
5. It should move into an incognito window.

Enjoy :D
